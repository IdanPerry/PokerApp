# PokerApp
# This is a little project i did a few years ago for the sake of learning Java and practice.
# I decided to come back to this and gradually improve the application and maybe add a new features.
# Currently it mimics a poker application played by 2 players on the same machine, since it doesn't supports server-client communication # # yet. hopefully it will do in time.
